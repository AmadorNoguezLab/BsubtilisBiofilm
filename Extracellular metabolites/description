Extracellular metabolites (interchangeably as supernatant/spent media)

We obtained extracellular samples (spent media) by removing pellicle biofilm from the well using the stainless steel mesh and centrifuge the remaining liquid using 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes
(max speed, tabletop centrifuge). We then ran the supernatant along with the pellicle in the same run on LC-MS. Data provided here in 2 biological replicates.
